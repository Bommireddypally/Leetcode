# Leetcode
A well-organized repository documenting my structured approach to Data Structures &amp; Algorithms.
Welcome to my complete Data Structures & Algorithms learning journey — a long-term project where I solve LeetCode problems, master core patterns, and prepare for Software Engineering Internships (2026) and MAANG interviews.

This repository documents everything:

Progress

Notes

Train/Test learning modules

Topic-wise problem sets

Clean, optimized solutions

My continuous growth as an engineer

🚀 Why I Built This Repository

I want to:

Build strong problem-solving skills

Become interview-ready for MAANG and top tech companies

Track my progress publicly

Stay consistent with DSA

Learn patterns, not just solutions

Share my journey with others preparing for coding interviews

This repo helps me stay accountable and organized.

📚 What This Repository Contains

This repo is divided into modules, each representing a core DSA topic.

1️⃣ Train/Test Learning Sets

Structured 50–50 split across topics to simulate a real DSA course:

Train Set → Learn patterns

Test Set → Evaluate mastery

Balanced across Easy/Medium/Hard

2️⃣ Topic-Wise Solutions

Each folder contains:

Problems

Code solutions

Time/Space complexity

Approaches

Notes & mistakes

Patterns learned

3️⃣ All LeetCode Solutions Covered

This includes (and will grow over time):

✔ Arrays & Strings

Basics → Sliding Window → Prefix → Two Pointers → Hard simulation problems

✔ Linked List

Reversal, cycles, merging, pointers, deep concepts

✔ Stack / Queue

Monotonic stack, Min stack, queue DLL structures

✔ Two Pointers

Classic interview pattern

✔ Sliding Window

Most common in FAANG interviews

✔ Binary Search

On arrays, answers, templates

✔ Trees & Binary Trees

DFS, BFS, recursion, LCA, construction

✔ Graphs

DFS, BFS, Topological sort, Union Find, shortest path

✔ Dynamic Programming

1D DP, 2D DP, knapsack, partitions, subsequences

✔ Heaps & Priority Queue

Scheduling, merging, streaming problems

✔ Greedy Algorithms

Jump Game, Gas Station, Candy, Interval Scheduling

✔ Backtracking

Combinations, permutations, constraints

✔ Math & Bit Manipulation

Multiple problems under each category — updated continuously.

🧩 My Approach to Learning DSA

I follow a structured learning cycle:

📌 Step 1 — Learn the Pattern

Understand template, common tricks, edge cases.

📌 Step 2 — Solve Train Set

Practice problems to build intuition.

📌 Step 3 — Solve Test Set

No hints, no solutions — evaluate mastery.

📌 Step 4 — Reflect

What did I do wrong?

What pattern did I miss?

Where did I waste time?

📌 Step 5 — Optimize

Rewrite clean, optimal solutions.

📈 Progress Tracking

I actively update:

Problem count

Topic-wise progress

Notes

Optimized solutions

Test results

Contest performance

My goal: Become interview-ready with 200+ high-quality solved problems.

🎯 Goals
Short-term goals

Complete LeetCode study plans (Top 150, 75, 30 Days)

Finish 200 core interview questions

Strengthen problem-solving speed

Long-term goals

Crack a top-tier internship (2026 batch)

Master all major DSA patterns

Build deep confidence with coding interviews

🛠️ Tech Stack

Commented explanations

💬 Final Notes

This repository is not just for storing solutions —
it's my complete engineering growth journal.

Every problem solved improves:

Pattern recognition

Understanding edge cases

Confidence in interviews

Coding style
